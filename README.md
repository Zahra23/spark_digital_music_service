Title : Digital Music Service :

Description:

Every time a user interacts with the service while they're playing songs, logging out, like in a song with a thumbs up, hearing an ad, or downgrading their service, it generates data.
All this data contains the key insights for keeping your users happy and helping your business thrive.
It's your job on the data team to predict which users are at risk to churn either downgrading from premium to free tier or cancelling their service altogether.
If you can accurately identify these users before they leave, your business can offer them discounts and incentives, potentially saving your business millions in revenue.
